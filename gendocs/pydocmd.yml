# This tells pydocmd which pages to generate from which Python modules,
# functions and classes. At the first level is the page name, below that
# is a tree of Python member names (modules, classes, etc.) that should be
# documented. Higher indentation leads to smaller header size.

    # If we end up wanting to include Bucket and Package inline in api.md, we
    # might just want to specify "__all__" in t4.__init__ and use 't4+' on the
    # line above this comment.  Specified explicitly for this example.

# Note: if using the simple generator mode, this will default to 'markdown'
